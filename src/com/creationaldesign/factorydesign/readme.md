The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. 
It is a pattern that promotes loose coupling between classes and promotes code reuse.

The Factory Method Design Pattern is particularly useful when we donâ€™t know the exact class of object that will be created at runtime
